# sc_fi_analysis
This project provides scRNA-seq data analysis and visualization features for ReactomeFIVIz in Python.

Resources in this project are used the the foundation for features provided in ReactomeFIViz. However, the project itself should provide many useful analysis and visualization approaches for single cell data sets, most of which are focused on scRNA-seq datasets.
